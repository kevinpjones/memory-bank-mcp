A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for remote memory bank management, inspired by [Cline Memory Bank](https://github.com/nickbaumann98/cline_docs/blob/main/prompting/custom%20instructions%20library/cline-memory-bank.md).

## Overview

The Memory Bank MCP Server transforms traditional file-based memory banks into a centralized service that:

- Provides remote access to memory bank files via MCP protocol
- Enables multi-project memory bank management
- Maintains consistent file structure and validation
- Ensures proper isolation between project memory banks

## Features

- **Multi-Project Support**

  - Project-specific directories
  - File structure enforcement
  - Path traversal prevention
  - Project listing capabilities
  - File listing per project

- **Remote Accessibility**

  - Full MCP protocol implementation
  - Type-safe operations
  - Proper error handling
  - Security through project isolation

- **Core Operations**
  - Read/write/update/delete memory bank files
  - Safe file deletion with automatic archiving
  - List available projects (excludes hidden directories)
  - List files within projects
  - Project existence validation
  - Safe read-only operations

- **Enhanced Security & Safety**
  - Hidden directory filtering (directories starting with `.` are excluded from project listings)
  - Safe file deletion with archiving (files are moved to `.archive/` with timestamps instead of permanent deletion)
  - Archive structure preserves original project organization
  - Timestamped file naming prevents conflicts: `filename-DELETED-<ISO8601-timestamp>.ext`

- **MCP Server Prompts Support**
  - Discover and execute reusable prompt templates
  - Parameter substitution with validation
  - Organized prompt storage in `.prompts` directory
  - Support for required and optional parameters

## Installation

To install Memory Bank Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@alioshr/memory-bank-mcp):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @alioshr/memory-bank-mcp --client claude
```

This will set up the MCP server configuration automatically. Alternatively, you can configure the server manually as described in the Configuration section below.

## Quick Start

1. Configure the MCP server in your settings (see Configuration section below)
2. Start using the memory bank tools in your AI assistant

## Using with Cline/Roo Code

The memory bank MCP server needs to be configured in your Cline MCP settings file. The location depends on your setup:

- For Cline extension: `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
- For Roo Code VS Code extension: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline/settings/mcp_settings.json`

Add the following configuration to your MCP settings:

```json
{
  "allpepper-memory-bank": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@allpepper/memory-bank-mcp"],
    "env": {
      "MEMORY_BANK_ROOT": "<path-to-bank>"
    },
    "disabled": false,
    "autoApprove": [
      "memory_bank_read",
      "memory_bank_write",
      "memory_bank_update",
      "memory_bank_delete",
      "list_projects",
      "list_project_files"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configuration Details

- `MEMORY_BANK_ROOT`: Directory where project memory banks will be stored (e.g., `/path/to/memory-bank`)
- `disabled`: Set to `false` to enable the server
- `autoApprove`: List of operations that don't require explicit user approval:
  - `memory_bank_read`: Read memory bank files
  - `memory_bank_write`: Create new memory bank files
  - `memory_bank_update`: Update existing memory bank files
  - `memory_bank_delete`: Delete memory bank files (archives them safely)
  - `list_projects`: List available projects (excludes hidden directories)
  - `list_project_files`: List files within a project

## MCP Server Prompts

The server supports the [MCP Server Prompts specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/prompts), allowing you to create and use reusable prompt templates.

### Prompt Storage

Prompts are stored as Markdown files in a `.prompts` directory at your memory bank root:
- YAML frontmatter contains metadata (name, title, description, arguments)
- Markdown content serves as the prompt template
- Use `{{param_name}}` syntax for parameter substitution

### Example Prompt File

Create `.prompts/code-review.md`:

```markdown
---
name: code-review
title: Code Review Assistant
description: Analyzes code for quality, best practices, and potential improvements
arguments:
  - name: code
    description: The code to review
    required: true
  - name: language
    description: Programming language of the code
    required: false
  - name: focus
    description: Specific aspect to focus on (security, performance, style, etc.)
    required: false
---

Please conduct a thorough code review of the following {{language}} code:

```{{language}}
{{code}}
```

Please pay special attention to: {{focus}}

Analyze the code for:
- Code quality and readability
- Best practices adherence
- Potential bugs or issues
- Performance considerations
- Security vulnerabilities
- Suggested improvements

Provide specific recommendations with explanations.
```

### Using Prompts

MCP clients can:
1. **Discover prompts**: Use `prompts/list` to see available prompt templates
2. **Execute prompts**: Use `prompts/get` with a prompt name and parameters to get the rendered result

### Sample Prompts Included

The server includes three sample prompts for immediate use:
- **code-review**: Analyzes code for quality and improvements
- **doc-generator**: Generates comprehensive documentation
- **explain-concept**: Explains technical concepts in simple terms

### Adding Custom Prompts

1. Create `.md` files in the `.prompts` directory
2. Include YAML frontmatter with prompt metadata
3. Use `{{param_name}}` for parameter substitution in the template
4. Define required and optional arguments in the metadata


## Using with Cursor

For Cursor, open the settings -> features -> add MCP server -> add the following:

```shell
env MEMORY_BANK_ROOT=<path-to-bank> npx -y @allpepper/memory-bank-mcp@latest
```
## Using with Claude

- Claude desktop config file: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Claude Code config file:  `~/.claude.json`

1. Locate the config file
3. Locate the property called `mcpServers`
4. Paste this:

```
 "allPepper-memory-bank": {
          "type": "stdio",
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "-y",
            "@allpepper/memory-bank-mcp@latest"
          ],
          "env": {
            "MEMORY_BANK_ROOT": "YOUR PATH"
          }
        }
```

## Custom AI instructions

This section contains the instructions that should be pasted on the AI custom instructions, either for Cline, Claude or Cursor, or any other MCP client. You should copy and paste these rules. For reference, see [custom-instructions.md](custom-instructions.md) which contains these rules.

   npm run serve
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration:**
   Set the `MEMORY_BANK_ROOT` environment variable to point to your memory bank directory.

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **"No projects found"**
   - Verify `MEMORY_BANK_ROOT` points to the correct directory
   - Ensure the directory contains project subdirectories
   - Check file permissions

2. **API errors**
   - Confirm the memory bank directory is accessible
   - Check that project directories contain files
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly

3. **Search not working**
   - Ensure project files contain searchable content
   - Try different search terms
   - Check that files are readable

**Performance Tips:**

- Large projects (>1000 files) may take longer to load
- Search performance depends on file sizes and content
- Consider organizing projects by logical boundaries

### Architecture

The web interface is built with:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes that reuse existing MCP server repositories
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E testing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dark mode support
- **Markdown**: React Markdown with GitHub Flavored Markdown and syntax highlighting

The interface integrates seamlessly with the existing Memory Bank MCP Server infrastructure, reusing the same repository patterns and use cases to ensure consistency and reliability.

## Development

Basic development commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run the server directly with ts-node for quick testing
npm run dev
```

### Running with Docker

1. Build the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t memory-bank-mcp:local .
    ```

2. Run the Docker container for testing:

    ```bash
    docker run -i --rm \
      -e MEMORY_BANK_ROOT="/mnt/memory_bank" \
      -v /path/to/memory-bank:/mnt/memory_bank \
      --entrypoint /bin/sh \
      memory-bank-mcp:local \
      -c "ls -la /mnt/memory_bank"
    ```
